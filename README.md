# Apollo8

With the increasing demand for organization and efficiency in SQL projects, I noticed a gap in the management process of SQL files. When working with large volumes of SQL files, I often found them scattered and disorganized, complicating the deployment process. With this in mind, I developed the Apollo8 project in Lua, which aims to transform the way we handle SQL files by offering an efficient folder structure. This approach provides a cleaner and more agile way to manage and deploy SQLs, improving the workflow and avoiding common issues of disorganization.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Configuration**
1. Ensure the main file (`apollo8.lua`) and related scripts (e.g., `help.lua`, `about.lua`, etc.) are in the same directory.
2. Optionally, add the Apollo8 directory to your system PATH for easier execution:

   - **Linux/macOS**:
